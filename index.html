          <h3>A humble beginning</h3>
          
          <p>It was August of 1973 and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130809-the-party-where-hip-hop-was-born"target="_blank">Cindy Campbell</a> just wanted to raise  money to buy clothes for back to school. She had an idea, a business venture and investment if you will, that would start off with the $25 rental of the rec room in the basement of the housing complex her family lived in. The Complex was located near the crossing of Sedgewick Avenue near Cedar Park in the South Bronx. Her plan was to take the $25 she had, rent the room, throw a back to school party charging a mere 25c for every female that attended and a double up of 50c for the fellas. Yeap, even in 1973 young men were getting fleeced out of their coins just to be in the presence of the neighborhoods flyest female forces. The most important element of it all would be the DJ. Yes, every party needs a DJ and Cindy had a secret weapon. She would get her elder brother, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130809-the-party-where-hip-hop-was-born"target="_blank">Clive Campbell</a>, who was only 16 and went by the name <a href="http://www.peoplestrive.com/mens-stories-misc-quotes/dj-kool-herc/"target="_blank">"DJ Kool Herc"</a>, to do the deed of spinning records for the rambunctious Bronx teens on that late August night.  With all her planning, hustling, marketing, and profiting, the one thing Cindy did not calculate into her plans was the stage she would set that would launch her brother into the stratosphere of cultural icons and gods, with an underground  culture form New York on his back that would resonate across the world for decades to come known as Hip Hop.
    </p> 
    

<p>Cindy Campbell's party was the opportunity Kool Herc had been looking for and working towards in his burgeoning DJ career. He and Cindy made a calculated guess that the young people of the community would come out due to the fact that they really had nowhere else to go. </p>
    
<p>The room in the basement of the housing complex had a capacity of about 100 people. On the night of the party the room was quickly packed to the maximum. Herc along with his friend Coke La Rock did their thing in turning the party out. While Herc DJ’d, at certain times during the records,  Coke La Rock would call friends names out on the microphone. He would also sing out syncopated chants to get the crowed involved in the party.  Herc’s style, record choices and sound was so eclectic and amazing that, once obscure records, would become historical staples of the culture. Records like, “Bongo Rock” and “Apache” by The Incredible Bongo Band, and a host of James Brown live in concert LP’s.</p>
          
          <h3>A new movement</h3>

<p>This party and the records he played would lead Herc to create a style of DJing he called  “The Merry Go Round”.  Herc noticed that at the bridge or what is also called the break of the records he was playing, dancers got really excited and more energetic. He quickly came up with the idea to use two of the same records in order to quickly switch back and forth between the records and the part in the song where the break began. He did this to elongate the period of time that people on the dance floor could dance to the break. This method quickly became synonymous with the basic sound of hip hop and is the foundation of break beats. It is due to these turn of events that the world owes a serious debt of grattitude to DJ Kool Herc and his sister Cindy Campbell. Without his creativity and Cindy's wish to buy new clothes, the culture of hip hop may have never come to fruition.
